# File used to configure the variables of the entire application
# and to store sensitive data. The original .env file is excluded
# from commitable files via .gitignore. The .exampleevn file
# contains a template, which needs to be renamed to .env to be
# loaded by settings.py and then visible to the application components.

# Remember that the values YOUR_XTB_DEMO_LOGIN, YOUR_XTB_DEMO_PASSWORD,
# etc. should be replaced with your real credentials.
